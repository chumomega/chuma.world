## WORK I’M MOST PROUD OF
- ✅ Leading the treasury STRIP data acquisition and calculation process for Bloomberg’s Domestic Fixed Income Indices
- ✅ Leading the migration of the European Asset Backed Security Indices at Bloomberg

- ✅ Leading the list recommendations and quick delivery features for the buy on Etsy mobile app.
- ✅ Building the end to end Pod Rank app to help save podcast listener time with deep insights before they press play.

## WHAT I CARE MOST ABOUT
- ✨Educating - I’ve had a passion for educating others since my childhood having 6 siblings to school where I served others as a math tutor. Nowadays, this takes the form of written word on my blog and documents, oral presentations, and 1 on 1 mentorship.
- ✨Efficiency - With so many things to do, I try to make the best use of my time always. This takes the form of parallelizing tasks and/or automating them when reasonable to do so.
- ✨Teamwork - I learned from a young age playing football that no matter how good 1 person is, you need a team with a collective vision to win. The same thing goes for solving complex problems in the tech world. An individual contributor can be good, but a cohesive team can be great.
